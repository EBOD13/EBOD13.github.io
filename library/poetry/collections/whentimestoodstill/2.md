In the hollow where your voice once rang,
Now only emptiness, a silent pang.
The quiet speaks volumes I cannot bear,
Echoes of laughter still hanging in air.

Each memory a ripple in time's still pond,
A bond that was broken, a magic beyond.
The silence screams louder than words ever could,
In this arrested moment, I finally understood.
