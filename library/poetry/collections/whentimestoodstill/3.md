When time resumes, as it always must,
And the present returns from the realm of dust,
I'll carry the stillness deep in my bones,
A sanctuary built from forgotten tones.

For in that suspension, I learned how to be,
More than just memory, more than just me.
Time may move forward, but part stays behind,
In that eternal moment I'll always find.
