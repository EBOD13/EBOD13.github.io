When time stood still, and shadows grew long,
The world held its breath, forgot its song.
In the space between heartbeats, I found you there,
Floating in silence, beyond all care.

The clock hands frozen, the sun in delay,
Nothing moved forward, nothing gave way.
Just the echo of moments that used to be,
And the ghost of your hand reaching out to me.

When time resumes, as it always must,
And the present returns from the realm of dust,
I'll carry the stillness deep in my bones,
A sanctuary built from forgotten tones.

For in that suspension, I learned how to be,
More than just memory, more than just me.
Time may move forward, but part stays behind,
In that eternal moment I'll always find.
