Sorry, Mom. I tried to have what you didn’t. <br>
I tried to find a loving, loyal partner; <br>
after seeing everything Dad did to you. <br>
The secrets. The lies. The pain. <br>
I saw how easily he walked away from it all. <br>

Even as a child, I could sense your despair— <br>
the pain you uttered under your breath. <br>
Every exhale of yours during the day was a call to victory, <br>
roaring like lightning. <br>

Every time you spoke, though gentle, <br>
your voice echoed deep within me <br>
a call to fight and to win. <br>
Such power reminded me of the sound of the Amazon warriors: <br>
loud, commanding, unbreakable. <br>
I heard it all, and it gave me strength.<br>
Whenever I was in a room with you, <br>
I knew I couldn’t cry<br>
for victory was ours.<br>

Yet, in the dawn of night, <br>
the sound of victory surrendered <br>
to the whimpers of despair.<br>
Broken as you were,<br>
you tried to hold it in, <br>
but your sigh carried the weight of everything unsaid. <br>

I was still a child, <br>
and yet I remember it all, <br>
the sobs that trembled through the dark <br>
the murmurs of your broken heart echoing a sisyphusphony, <br>
burying me beneath the weight of a pain
you never dared to express. <br>
