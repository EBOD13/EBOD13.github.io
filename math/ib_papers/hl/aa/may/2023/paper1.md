## Question 1

**Content:** The function $f$ is defined by $f(x) = \frac{7x+7}{2x-4}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R},\, x \ne 2.$

(a) Find the zero of $f(x)$  
(b) For the graph of $y = f(x)$, write down the equation of  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the vertical asymptote  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the horizontal asymptote  
(c) Find $f^{-1}(x)$, the inverse function of $f(x).$

**Solution:**

(a) To find the zero, set $f(x) = 0$:
$$\frac{7x+7}{2x-4} = 0$$
$$7x + 7 = 0$$

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <div style="display: inline-block; border: 1px solid black; padding: 4px;">
    $x = -1$
  </div>
</div>

(b)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To find the vertical asymptote, set the denominator equal to zero.
$$2x-4 = 0$$
$$2x = -4$$
$$x=-2$$
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) To find the horizontal asymptote, we find the limit of the function as $x$ approaches infinity:
$$\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{7x+7}{2x-4} = \frac{7}{2}$$
$$y = \frac{7}{2}$$

(c) To find the inverse:
$$y = \frac{7x+7}{2x-4}$$
Swap $x$ and $y$ and solve for $y$:
$$x = \frac{7y+7}{2y-4}$$
$$x(2y-4) = 7y+7$$
$$2xy - 4x = 7y + 7$$
$$2xy - 7y = 4x + 7$$
$$y(2x - 7) = 4x + 7$$
$$y = \frac{4x+7}{2x-7}$$
Therefore:
$$f^{-1}(x) = \frac{4x+7}{2x-7}$$

## Question 2

**Content:** On a Monday at an amusement park, a sample of 40 visitors was randomly selected as they were leaving the park. They were asked how many times that day they had been on a ride called The Dragon. This information is summarized in the following frequency table.

<br/>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="6" style="text-align: center; ">
 
<!-- Header -->
  <tr>
    <th style="padding: 5px;"><strong>Number of times on The Dragon</strong></th>
    <th style="padding: 5px;"><strong>Frequency</strong></th>
  </tr>
<!-- Rows -->
  <tr><td>0</td><td>6</td></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>16</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>13</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>3</td></tr>
</table>

<br/>
It can be assumed that this sample is representative of all visitors to the park for the following day.

(a) For the following day, Tuesday, estimate

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the probability that a randomly selected visitor will ride <i>The Dragon</i>.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) the expected number of times a visitor will ride <i>The Dragon</i>.

It is known that 1000 visitors will attend the amusement park on Tuesday. The Dragon can carry a maximum of 10 people each time it runs.

(b) Estimate the minimum number of times <i>The Dragon</i> must run to satisfy demand.
